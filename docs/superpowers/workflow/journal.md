## Iteration 1 — 2026-09-27
- Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-27-it01-environment-foundation.md
- Shipped: M1. uv Python 3.12 venv with bounded pins and one OpenCV, `arcade doctor`, `tools/env_check.py`; show foundation (config, 5x7 font, display protocol with fake/SDL, raw Colorlight backend, DDP 0x0B unscaled); `ArcadeConfig` per spec 4.3 and `arcade/calibration.py`. 7 commits e36dba4..040ff3f.
- Review: APPROVED after 1 round (0 blocking; 12 plan-defect notes, carried)
- Deploy: none (phase 1)
- Verify: 6/6 checklist items applicable passed (freshness: evidence sha 040ff3f = HEAD; items 6-7 have no sheets or GIFs before games exist). Evidence: docs/superpowers/workflow/evidence/it01/
- Tests: 66 collected, 66 passed, 0 skipped (first entry; baseline)
- Verdict: the environment works end to end on this Mac, pose included, and camera and mic permissions are already granted, so the pre-flight doctor item is done. No success criterion is scorable yet; none regressed.
- Loop decisions (journaled, not asked): mediapipe pinned `>=1.0,!=1.0.1,<2` (1.0.1 aborts on PoseLandmarker open on macOS arm64); Colorlight brightness packet corrected to Falcon Player's layout (EtherType 0x0A<b>) and pixel order RGB, both to confirm with the `rgb` pattern at GATE B; default calibration zone (0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.8); frame packet sent before rows (Falcon Player order, one push of latency).
- Operator tooling finding (owner item, raised at the iteration-2 gate): `stop.py` counts every blocked stop, including turns that end while an agent is in flight, so `iterations-per-run: 2` was used up waiting for the plan writer in iteration 1, not by iterations. The loop enforces the iteration cap itself at step 8. Proposed fix: do not block or count when state.md `in_flight` names an agent.
- Carried forward: C1-C4 (Colorlight and display hardening, must land before GATE B), C5-C9 (config and calibration validation, test and tooling tightening); see roadmap Carried fixes.
- Status: done

Owner intervention, 2026-09-27, during iteration 2's plan phase: the owner asked whether iteration plans get adversarial reviews (they did not; iteration 1's 12 plan defects surfaced only after implementation) and approved adding one (decisions.md Q6, operator design step 2a, config "Plan review: required"). Applies from iteration 2's plan.
